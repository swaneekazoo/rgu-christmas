Sorry this is late; I had various irritations regarding Moodle on my end, but this is what of it there is.

I use some terminology that might seem weird, but the more frequent ones are:

"vex" = velocity on the x axis, same deal for "vey";
"accx" = acceleration on x, same for "accy".

Cheers,
